# Contributing Guidelines for Dad's First Step

## 1. Repository Workflow

### 1.1 Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for ongoing development
- `feature/*`: Individual feature development
- `hotfix/*`: Critical bug fixes
- `release/*`: Preparing for a new production release

### 1.2 Branch Naming Conventions
- Feature branches: `feature/short-description`
  - Example: `feature/milestone-tracking`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/issue-description`
  - Example: `hotfix/firebase-auth-error`
- Release branches: `release/version-number`
  - Example: `release/1.2.0`

## 2. Commit Guidelines

### 2.1 Conventional Commits
Use the following commit message format:
```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Commit Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting, missing semicolons
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without changing functionality
- `test`: Adding or modifying tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, updates to build processes

#### Examples:
```
feat(auth): add Google Sign-In functionality
fix(milestone): resolve data persistence issue
docs(readme): update installation instructions
refactor(firebase): improve error handling
```

### 2.2 Commit Best Practices
- Keep commits small and focused
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## 3. Pull Request (PR) Guidelines

### 3.1 PR Creation
- Always create PRs from feature branches to `develop`
- Use descriptive PR titles
- Provide a comprehensive PR description
  - What changes were made?
  - Why were these changes necessary?
  - Any potential side effects?

### 3.2 PR Review Checklist
- Code follows project coding standards
- Tests are added/updated
- Documentation is updated
- No unnecessary changes
- Passes all automated checks

## 4. Code Quality

### 4.1 Linting and Formatting
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Run `npm run lint` before committing
- Automatic formatting is enabled

### 4.2 Testing
- Write unit tests for new features
- Maintain at least 80% test coverage
- Run `npm test` before submitting PRs

## 5. Environment and Secrets

### 5.1 Environment Variables

- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Store sensitive information in secure environment variables

### 5.2 Dependency Management

- Update dependencies regularly
- Run security audits with `npm audit`

## 6. Performance and Optimization

### 6.1 Performance Checks

## 10. Continuous Integration

### 10.1 CI/CD Checks
- Automated linting
- Unit and integration tests
- Build verification
- Deployment checks
